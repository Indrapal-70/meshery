On Windows systems, `mesheryctl` can be installed via Scoop or [downloaded directly](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/releases/latest).

## Install `mesheryctl` as a direct download

Follow the installation steps to install the `mesheryctl` CLI. Then, execute:

{{< code code="./mesheryctl system start" >}}

If you are installing Meshery on Docker, execute the following command:

{{< code code="./mesheryctl system start -p docker" >}}

Optionally, move the `mesheryctl` binary to a directory in your `PATH`.


## Uninstalling `mesheryctl`

To uninstall `mesheryctl`, use `scoop uninstall mesheryctl` if installed via Scoop. If you installed `mesheryctl` via direct download, remove `mesheryctl` by deleting the binary file from wherever it is located on your `PATH`.

{{% alert color="info" title="NOTE" %}}
Running `mesheryctl system uninstall` removes a Meshery deployment from your system. This is distinct from removing the `mesheryctl` CLI binary itself.

  </pre>

Type `yes` when prompted to choose to configure a file. To get started, choose Docker as your platform to deploy Meshery. -->
